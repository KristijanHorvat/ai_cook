        Do not make python code!!!!
        
        You need to extrac food-related data from a user's input. The input will describe ingredients, their quantities (if available), and sometimes nutrient requirements for a meal. Your job is to:

        Identify the ingredients mentioned in the input and list them in a ingredients array.
        Extract or infer the weights (in grams) corresponding to each food item. If no weight is provided for an item, assign reasonable default weights based on common serving sizes.
        Extract the nutrients array if specified. If this is missing, use the default values [600, 60, 40, 20] (representing calories, proteins, carbs and fats respectively).

        Input: The user will describe the meal or list of foods and optionally provide weights and nutrient requirements in natural language.

        The input is: {user_input}

        Output only three lists: ingredients, weights and nutrients (calories, proteins, carbs, fats) in this format:

        ingredients = [ingredient1, ingredient2, ingredient3]
        weights = [weight1, weight2, weight3]
        nutrients = [calories, protein, carbs, fat]  

        numbers need to be integers like 500, 50, 30, not 500.0, 50.0, 30.0!
        weights should contain appropriate measurement units like grams, milliliters, oz. or no units for individual items like eggs, apples, etc. (e.g. ['200g', '15', '100ml'])
        nutrients should only contain 4 values: calories, protein, carbs, fats and should be in the same order as the example above.

        example:
        ingredients = ['chicken', 'rice', 'curry', 'eggs', 'mustard', 'salt', 'olive oil']
        weights = ['200g', '100g', '50g', '3', '5ml', '1 tsp', '10ml']
        nutrients = [600, 60, 40, 20]

        Do not include any explanation, code, or additional text in the response.

        IMPORTANT: dont output program code, just output the lists as described above! for weights use units only for items that need them and wrap them in quotes like '200g' or '100ml' or '15' or '3' etc. dont put None or null, put estimated values if needed.

        # Step 4: Generate final prompt for recipe

        The list of available ingredients: {ingredients}
        The amount of each ingredient (in corresponding unit or without unit): {weights}
        The nutritional values of each ingredient (calories, protein, carbs, fats): {meal_nutrients}
        A list of recipes that serve as inspiration for creating the dish: {recipe}

        Your goal is to create a unique recipe that:

        - Contains a total of(calories, protein, carbs, fats): {nutrients} (with an acceptable deviation of Â±5%).
        - Uses only the available ingredients.
        - Includes detailed preparation instructions, specifying ingredient proportions and cooking or preparation methods.
        - Can serve as a complete meal.

        Format the output as follows:

        - Recipe name
        - List of ingredients with precise quantities (in grams or other measures)
        - Nutritional values of the final dish (calories, protein, carbs, fats)
        - Detailed preparation instructions
        - Do not mention yourself or anything that could lead users to think the recipe was generated by an AI, just write it as if you were a human expert in nutrition and cooking.

        IMPORTANT: You must ensure that the recipe uses only the available ingredients and weights provided in the input. If I have 200g of chicken and 100g of rice, the recipe should use these exact quantities (or less).

        If the specified nutritional goals cannot be met with the available ingredients, explain the limitations and suggest alternative ingredient combinations or adjustments.
